// the msr and mrs instructions only allow immediates for selecting the architecture specific registers to act on so in
// order to provide arbitrary register access to the VM without metamorphism (which is disallowed by HVCI) we simply
// generate stubs for all possible registers into an array, and shove them into an executable section.  Note that this
// must be constexpr so that it can go into a read-only section because W^X is enforced

// arguments to (mrs|msr) instruction:
//
// [ 0: 4] <Xt> (x0 for us)
// [ 5: 7] op2
// [ 8:11] crm
// [12:15] crn
// [16:18] op1
// [19:19] op0
//
// so we need to iterate over all possible values in [5:19], meaning 0x8000 functions for both instruction
