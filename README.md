    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along

    Linking PawnIO statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
    combined work based on PawnIO. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
    General Public License cover the whole combination.

    In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of PawnIO give
    you permission to combine PawnIO program with free software programs or
    libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with independent modules
    that communicate with PawnIO solely through the device IO control
    interface. You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of
    the GNU GPL for PawnIO and the licenses of the other code concerned,
    provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as
    the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

    Note that this exception does not include programs that communicate with
    PawnIO over the Pawn interface. This means that all modules loaded into
    PawnIO must be compatible with this licence, including the earlier
    exception clause. We recommend using the GNU Lesser General Public License
    version 2.1 to fulfill this requirement.

    For alternative licensing options, please contact the copyright holder at
    admin@namazso.eu.

    Note that people who make modified versions of PawnIO are not obligated to
    grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their
    choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission
    to release a modified version without this exception; this exception also
    makes it possible to release a modified version which carries forward this
    exception.
